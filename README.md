# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection using CNN + Android App

This project is an **end-to-end plant disease detection system**.  
It includes:  
1. **Machine Learning model training (TensorFlow/Keras)** using a combined plant leaf disease dataset.  
2. **Trained TensorFlow Lite model** for deployment on Android.  
3. **Android app** that allows users to capture or upload an image of a leaf and get predictions about the disease with **cause and treatment info in English & Bangla**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We used the **Leaf Disease Dataset Combination** from Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Leaf Disease Dataset (Kaggle)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_54rxmRQi9pHFhF-OBkQH7qR8lCWziRe/view?usp=sharing)  

- Total Images: **39400**
- Classes: **17 plant disease + healthy classes**
- Train / Validation / Test split already available in the dataset

## ðŸ§  Model Training

The model is a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** with **Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Data Augmentation** for better generalization.  
Trained on **Google Colab** using a **T4 GPU**.  

### Model Architecture:
- **4 Convolutional Blocks**
- **GlobalAveragePooling**
- **Dense layers with Dropout**
- **Output Layer: 17 softmax classes**

### Key Parameters:
- Image Size: **128x128**
- Batch Size: **32**
- Optimizer: **Adam**
- Loss: **Categorical Crossentropy**
- Epochs: **20 (EarlyStopping applied)**

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

- Training Accuracy: ~95.33%
- Validation Accuracy: ~95.87%
- The model performs well on unseen data with generalizable predictions.

## ðŸ“± Android App

We converted the trained model into **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)** and integrated it into an Android app.

### App Features:
âœ… Capture a photo using the camera or select from the gallery  
âœ… Predicts disease and shows result instantly  
âœ… Tap prediction to view **cause & treatment (English + Bangla)**  
âœ… Handles errors (like no image selected)  
âœ… Simple and professional **Material Design UI**

### Supported Classes:
- **Apple:** Apple Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust, Healthy  
- **Cherry:** Powdery Mildew, Healthy  
- **Corn:** Cercospora Leaf Spot, Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy  
- **Grape:** Black Rot, Esca (Black Measles), Leaf Blight, Healthy  
- **Potato:** Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy
